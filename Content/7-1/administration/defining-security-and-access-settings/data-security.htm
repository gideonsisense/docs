        <h1>Data Security</h1>
        <p>Data security in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> can be divided into two types, data encryption and data access. Data communication is related to how data is secured by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> while be imported into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> and written on your server’s disk.</p>
        <p>When data is imported into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />, the protocol used depends on the protocols supported by the data source. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> supports importing data over SSL, if the source supports it. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> supports SSL for data Retrieval, for example, when viewing data in dashboards.</p>
        <p>Configuration data, such as account credentials and authorization profiles, are encrypted prior to being written to the disk. The encryption technology used by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> includes:</p>
        <p>1. SHA-256</p>
        <p>2. TripleDES</p>
        <p>3. AES-256</p>
        <p>For data at rest, Sisense supports OS based disk encryption, Windows file system encryption. For more information, click <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/file-encryption">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The second type of data security is data access. This type of data security refers to who can access your data after its imported into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> and displayed in a dashboard.</p>
        <p class="bold">What is Data Access Security?</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> enables you to define Data Security Rules that control which users can access which portions of the raw data in an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />, down to row granularity. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each widget only shows the data permitted by the Data Security Rules that apply, including totals, averages and so on.</li>
            <li>The data browsers used while building dashboards and widgets only show the data permitted by the Data Security Rules that apply.</li>
            <li>You can define a single dashboard that automatically displays different results for each user (or user group), based on the rows that user is permitted to see.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">Use Case Example</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Sales Order table has a column representing the salesperson that closed a deal.</li>
            <li>You created a quarterly performance dashboard for your salespeople, but want each of them to see only their own data.</li>
            <li>You do not want any of them to be exposed to data that represents the performance of others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">How Does Data Access Security Work?</p>
        <p>The Sisense security model is designed to work in a 'Grant access' model, and not in a 'Deny access' model.</p>
        <p>By default, when applying a data security rule, access is blocked for everyone, and the best practice is to leave 'Everyone else' set to 'Nothing', while granting groups and users with access to specific data values. The model accumulates grants, meaning that the most permissive combination wins. So if both a group and one of its members have conflicting rules, the permissive combination wins.</p>
        <p>Each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> contains tables and each table contains fields. A Data Security Rule defines that a specific user can only see any data of an entire row of a table, if a specific field in that row has a specific value(s).</p>
        <p>For example, in a Sales widget a salesperson (for example, Dan) will only see the sales amounts from the rows of a Sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> whose Salesperson field contains the value Dan (rows 1 and 4).</p>
        <p class="bold">Sales Table</p>
