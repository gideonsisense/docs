            <li>
                <span class="bold">Performance</span>: As with any deployment, you must provide sufficient CPU and memory on the client and the server for your anticipated user load.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Availability</span>: What is your desired up-time and how many resources can you dedicate to maintaining system availability.</li>
