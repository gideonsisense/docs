        <h1>Migrating <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> across Environments</h1>
        <p>Many users that implement <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> maintain copies of their dashboards locally or across multiple environments for a variety of reasons. With multiple instances of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />, you can test and verify your data’s accuracy before publishing dashboards to a production environment where accuracy is critical. You can save external copies of dashboards for disaster recovery. OEMs can support a master server and separate servers for each of their customers, copying the relevant dashboards from the master server to the appropriate customer server. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> enables Administrators and Designers to maintain multiple copies of their dashboards and migrate them quickly and easily across multiple environments.</p>
        <p>There are two options for migrating dashboards from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />. The first option is to export your dashboards into a .dash file locally, and then import the dashboards into the relevant environments. This option is useful if you do not have access to the server, for example, if you are an OEM providing dashboards to your customers. For more information about exporting dashboards, see Exporting <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Dashboards.</p>
        <p>The second option is to copy the dashboard to another server from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />. In this scenario, you can copy dashboards from one environment directly to another environment after the Administrator of the target server provides access to the source server. The target server can only accept files from servers available on the Trusted Server List. For example, if you have two machines with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> installed, on the server where you want to copy dashboards to, you can provide access to the source server by adding the source server’s IP address to my list of allowed servers.</p>

        </p>
        <p>After providing access, an Administrator or Designer can copy the dashboard directly to the target server. If the dashboard already exists on the target server, the Administrator or Designer will be notified and can overwrite the existing dashboard or create a duplicate dashboard on the target server.</p>
        <p>The option you choose depends on which methodology is convenient for you and what you need to achieve. The end result is the same.</p>
        <p>There are several thing you should remember when copying a dashboard to another server. First, copied dashboards and their widgets keep their IDs. This ensures that any users with bookmarks of the dashboard or its widgets can continue using the same bookmarks. If the dashboards already exist on the recipient server, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> prompts you to select how you want to handle each dashboard that already exists. In the Copy Dashboards to Server window, a list of all the dashboards to be copied to the recipient server is displayed. The list includes the dashboards name, the destination path where the dashboard is to be copied, and several options for how you wish to handle the dashboard in case it already exists.</p>
        <p>In the example below, you can see that the Sample – Healthcare dashboard has been renamed to “Renamed Dashboard”. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> recognizes that these dashboards are the same even though the name on the recipient server has been changed.</p>
        <p>For the Sample – Ecommerce dashboard, the dashboard has been saved in a folder called “test” on the recipient server. The dashboards full destination path on the recipient server is displayed. When the dashboard is located in the main navigation tree, only the dashboard name is displayed.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Second, when copying a dashboard, the dashboard’s scripts on the target server are overwritten. The scripts from the source dashboard are used instead. If your data source is not the same in each environment, you will need to manually adjust the data source after copying the dashboards. If plug-ins are installed on the original server, these plug-ins will not work on the dashboard unless they are also installed on the target server.</p>
        <p>Third, changes to your dashboards are not reflected on the same dashboard in another environment. To modify a remote dashboard you can either modify it on the remote server, or modify it in your source server, and repeat the migration process. Once you have completed your changes, you will need to republish the dashboard.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Copying Dashboards between <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Servers</h2>
        <p>Administrators and Designers with access to a remote Sisense server can copy dashboards from one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> server to another from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />. When you copy a dashboard or a folder to a remote server, all the dashboards, including those in the selected folders are duplicated into the main Dashboard list in the target server. Folders are not duplicated on the target server.</p>
        <p>Before copying a dashboard to a target server, the Administrator of the target server must provide access to target server. The procedure below explains how to provide access to another server and then how to copy a dashboard from the source server to the target server through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />.</p>
        <span class="bold">Note</span>: When migrating a dashboard to another server, you must be logged in to your local server with the IP address as the URL. You cannot copy dashboards from localhost.<p class="bold">To copy your dashboard to another <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> server:</p><span class="bold">Note</span>: Some of the dialog boxes may be considered as pop-ups by your ad blockers.
