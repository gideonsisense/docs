        <h1>Setting Up a Custom Email Server</h1>
        <p>Sisense includes a default email server configuration, which uses Mandrill by MailChimp to send automated emails such as dashboard reports or password reset emails.  This configuration can be used for POC and testing environments. For production environments, you should provide your own email server. Custom email servers allow all your email transactions to be completely managed on your side.</p>
        <p>Through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> REST API, you can send an HTTP POST request to issue <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> emails through your own custom email server instead of the default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> email server. The REST API exposes properties that you can configure for the custom email servers such as security, timeout, and logging properties.</p>
        <li>When authenticating an HTTP request, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"></MadCap:variable> only supports the basic authentication through the Authorization method using plain text.</li>
        <p class="bold">To set up a custom email server:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />, click Admin, and then Rest API, followed by REST API Reference.</li>
            <li>In version 1.0 of the REST API, select Settings, then POST /settings/email_server.</li>
            <li>In the body of your call, define the values of the following keys:</li>
        </ol>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>

        <p>To troubleshoot any issue with your custom email server, activate logging through the <span class="bold">logger</span> and <span class="bold">debug</span> keys in the REST API. When <span class="bold">logger</span> and <span class="bold">debug</span> are set to True, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> generates logs that are saved in the following directory:</p>
        <p class="code">c:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\vnext\iisnode</p>
        <p>After troubleshooting the issue, the debug logger should be disabled as the logs can grow in size rapidly and this may impact performance.</p>
