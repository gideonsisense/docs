        <h1>Integrating Active Directory</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> supports integrating Active Directory users and groups with your current <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users,  so that you can share dashboards and email reports with any of your users. This works in parallel with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s existing User Management, so you can continue to add users and user groups that are not part of the Active Directory domain.</p>
        <p>To enable <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> to identify your Active Directory users, you import your Active Directory users and groups into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />. When you import an Active Directory user, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> automatically creates a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user. When you import an Active Directory group, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> does not automatically create a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user for each member. The first time a member of an Active Directory group logs into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />, then <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> automatically creates a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user. Active Directory users that do not log in, are not assigned a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user until their first login.</p>
        <p>This section describes how to configure Active Directory in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />, and how to import users and user groups from Active Directory.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Adding an Active Directory Domain to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /></h2>
        <p>From the Active Directory page, you can add Active Directory domains to your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> configuration. Each Active Directory domain you add to your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> configuration is added to the Active Directory list displayed in the Active Directory page. The first time you open the Active Directory page, the Add Domain link is displayed, which you can click to begin adding Active Directory domains.</p>
        <p>After you have added your first Active Directory domain, it is displayed in the Active Directory list.</p>
        <p>From the Active Directory list, you can add additional Active Directory domains. Each Active Directory domain  you add to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> enables you to share your dashboards and reports with users from any of the domains  as well as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users not part an Active Directory.</p>
        <p>You can filter the list of the Active Directory domains by entering the name of the relevant domain in the Search field.</p>
        <p class="bold">To add an Active Directory:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Admin</span> and select the <span class="bold">Active Directory</span> tab on the left.</li>
            <li>In the Active Directory page, click <span class="bold">Add Domain</span>.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Add Domain</span> window, fill in the Active Directory configuration fields to point to your Active Directory instance:<br /><ul><li><span class="bold">Name</span>: The name of your Active Directory domain. This name is used to locate your Active Directory domain in Sisense when you have multiple domains.</li><li><span class="bold">Connection String</span>: The full path to your Active Directory domain. Example: <span class="bold">ldap://dc.domain.com</span></li><li><span class="bold">Base DN</span>: The Active Directory location from where a server searches for users. Enter the domain by its distinguished name (DN) with its domain components (DC) connected by commas.<br />For example: For the domain domain.sisense.test, use <span class="bold">DC=domain,DC=sisense,DC=test</span>.<br /><span class="bold">Note</span>: If you have a hierarchy of user groups in your organization, you can define the hierarchy in your string as follows:</li><li>If your domain is domain.sisense.com/OU1/OU2, then use <span class="bold">OU=OU2, OU=OU1,DC=domain,DC=sisense,DC=com</span>. Only users and user groups from OU2 will be available. Users/groups under OU1 will not be available.</li><li><span class="bold">Username</span>: Enter the username with domain. Example: <span class="bold">domain\username</span></li><li><span class="bold">Password</span>: Enter the password for your Active Directory instance.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Test</span> to verify that your configuration successfully connects to your Active Directory domain.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Sync Data</span> field, select the frequency that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> automatically synchronizes with the users and groups in this Active Directory domain.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="notoc">Editing Active Directory Domain Settings</h3>

        <h3 class="notoc">Disabling an Active Directory Domain</h3>
        <p>Supports allows you to disable Active Directory domains  in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p>An Active Directory domain that has been disabled is still displayed in the Active Directory list, however, users from this domain will not be able to log in to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />, and you will not be able to share dashboards or reports with them.</p>
        <p>Disabled Active Directory domains have the status Disabled in the Status column in the Active Directory list.</p>
        <p class="bold">To disable an Active Directory domain:</p>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="notoc">Deleting an Active Directory</h3>

        <h2 class="notoc">Adding a User from Active Directory</h2>
        <p>Once a connection with Active Directory has been established, an additional <span class="bold">Import from External Server</span> option is added to the <span class="bold">Add Users</span> button in the User tab.</p>
        <p>The user’s username and email will be added from Active Directory.</p>
        <span class="bold">Note</span>: You can add a user from Active Directory, even if you have not imported that user’s user group from Active Directory.<p>See <a href="manage-dashboard-user.htm">Managing Dashboard Users</a> for general information about working with users/user groups in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p><h2 class="notoc">Adding a User Group from Active Directory</h2><p>Once a connection with Active Directory has been established, an additional <span class="bold">IMPORT FROM ACTIVE DIRECTORY</span> option is added to the <span class="bold">ADD GROUP</span> button in the <span class="bold">GROUPS</span> tab.</p><p>The following procedure describes how to import a list of users from a group in Active Directory to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p><p>Users that are added in this way only appear in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users list after each user logs in to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />. In this way, your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> license slots are only consumed by users who actually log in to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p><p class="bold">To add a user group from Active Directory:</p><ol><li>Click <span class="bold">Admin</span> and select the<span class="bold"> Groups</span> tab on the left.</li><li>Click the <span class="bold">Add Group</span> button and then select the <span class="bold">From Active Directory</span> option from the menu.</li><li>In the <span class="bold">Search Active Directory Group</span> field start typing in the name of the desired Active Directory Group.

You can add multiple Active Directory groups, by selecting one group after another. The groups appear in this window as follows:</li><li>Select the default Role for the members of this user group: Viewer or Designer. It will be assigned to new users from this group, when the users are created. Subsequently, user’s role can be changed in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Users list.<br />Changes to a group’s default role will affect users created after that time, but will not affect existing users.</li><li>Click <span class="bold">Add</span>.</li></ol></body>
