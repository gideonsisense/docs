        <h1>Managing User Groups</h1>
        <p>This topic describes how to add and use user groups in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p class="bold">How Do User Groups Work?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When building and sharing dashboards, wherever you can select a user, you can also select a user group. For example, you can share a dashboard with an entire user group at once.</li>
            <li>When you add an additional user to an existing user group, then that user is automatically awarded the permissions of that user group.</li>
            <li>When users are added in Active Directory to a previously imported Active Directory user group, then those users are automatically added to the corresponding <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user group.</li>
            <li>User groups can only contain users. They do not support nested user groups.</li>
            <li>Additional users cannot be added to a user group that was imported from Active Directory.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can add users to a user group using the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add existing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users to a user group</li>
            <li>Add a user group from Active Directory</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="notoc">Accessing User Group Management</h2>
        <p>You can add, edit and delete user groups, and assign users to them.</p>
        <p class="bold">To access the user group settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Admin </span>and select the <span class="bold">Groups</span> tab on the left. A list of the previously defined user groups is displayed. The <span class="bold">Origin</span> column displays <span class="bold"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /></span> or <span class="bold">Active Directory</span> to indicate whether the user group was defined in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> or imported from Active Directory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no user groups have yet been defined, the following message is displayed: No Groups Found</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Adding a New User Group</h2>
        <p>The following procedure describes how to add a new user group by selecting users from existing users in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p>See <a href="integrate-active-directory.htm">Adding a User Group from Active Directory</a> for a description of how to add a user group from Active Directory.</p>
        <p class="bold">To add a new user group:</p>

            <li>In a <span class="bold">Group Name</span> field, enter the name for this user group.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Group Users</span> field select each of the users that belong to this group. To add each user, start typing in the user’s name. An auto-complete list is displayed showing the users that already exist in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />. Select a username to add to the group.<br /><span class="bold">Note</span>: If you want, you can leave the group empty and add members to it later.</li>
            <li>(Optional) The <span class="bold">Default Language</span> for a group is the language set by an Administrator for that server. From the Default Language list, you can select another default language for a group. For example, if your server supports groups located in different countries, you can set the language for each group.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Select the default user role. Each member of the group is assigned this role when they are added to the group</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Create</span>.</li>
