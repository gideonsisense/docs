        <h1>Limiting Access to the Application Database</h1>
        <p>For security reasons, by default, access to application database from outside of localhost (127.0.0.1) is prevented.</p>
        <p>If you need to access the application database from an IP address other than localhost, you can add the IP address of that server to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> MongoDB configuration file, which contains a list of all servers allowed to access the application database. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> MongoDB configuration file, mongodb.conf, is located in the following directory</p>
        <p class="code">…\Program Files\Sisense\Infra\MongoDB\</p>
        <p>To allow external IP addresses to access your application database, add the IP addresses in this format  [127.0.0.1, XX.XX.XX.X] as the value of bindIp, or change it to 0.0.0.0 to enable connections from any IP.</p>
        <p class="code">net:</p>
        <p class="code">bindIp: [127.0.0.1, XX.XX.XX.XX]</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>: The value of bindIp has been changed from an array to a string. As a string, the IP addresses should be separated by a comma with no space in between. In addition, the only IP addresses to be included in the string as 127.0.0.1 and the public IP of your local server.</p>
