        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>:</p>
        <p>The Splunk SDK for C# v1.0.x is deprecated, and has been replaced by the Splunk SDK for C# 2.0. Unlike the Splunk SDK for C# 1.0.x, the Splunk SDK for C# 2.0 abides by .NET guidelines, as well as FxCop and StyleCop rules.In addition, the API client in Splunk SDK for C# 2.0 is a Portable Class Library (PCL), and supports cross-platform development.Version 2 of the SDK is incompatible with version 1, and applications built with Splunk SDK for C# version 1.0.x will not recompile using Splunk SDK for C# version 2.0. See Migrating from Splunk SDK for C# v1.0.x for more information.</p>
