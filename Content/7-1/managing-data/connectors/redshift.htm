        <h1>Connecting to Redshift</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">IMPORTANT</span>: On October 23, 2017, Amazon Redshift is replacing the SSL certificates on your cluster with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) issued certificates. ACM is a trusted public certificate authority (CA) that is trusted by most current systems.In order to continue importing data into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> with the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Redshift connector, you must apply the new ACM certificate. Amazon provides a Certificate Authority, which needs to be saved on a Windows machine.</p>
        <p class="bold">To replace your certificate:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/redshift-ca-bundle.crt">Redshift Certificate Authority Bundle</a>.</li>
            <li>Place the certificates from the bundle in your root.crt file. On Microsoft Windows, the file is <span class="code">%APPDATA%\postgresql\root.crt</span></li>
        </ol>For more information, see Transitioning to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-transitioning-to-acm-certs.html#connecting-transitioning-to-acm-other-ssl-types">ACM Certificates for SSL Connections</a>.<h2 class="notoc">Introduction</h2><p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> enables easy and quick access to databases, tables and views contained within Amazon RedShift  databases.
