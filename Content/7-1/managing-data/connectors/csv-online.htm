        <h1>Connecting to CSV</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> enables easy and quick access to tables contained within CSV files.</p>
        <p>There are two options for uploading data, the first is to upload your file to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server. Once the file is uploaded, the data will be imported into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> as it was at the time the file was uploaded.</p>
        <p>The second option is to define the location of your files on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server. This is the preferred option if your Excel files frequently change, but remain in the same location on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server as the data is taken from the Excel files each time the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> is built.</p>
        <p>When you import multiple files from a folder and build your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />, the data is combined together in a single table. To build multiple tables with separate tables for each file, you must repeat the process for each file you want to import as a table.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Notes</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that all the files adhere to the same structure, including the presence or absence of headers in the first row. Files will be added to the table based on their file names in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li>When you import multiple files from a folder and build your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />, the data is combined together in a single table. To build multiple tables with separate tables for each file, you must repeat the process for each file you want to import as a table. If you have any questions about data accumulation between builds, please contact our support team.</li>
            <li>If your CSV file contains special symbols or foreign characters, the import process may fail. To resolve this issue, convert the CSV file to the UTF-8 format. One way to do this is to open the .csv file in an application like Notepad, and then select <span class="bold">File</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Save</span> As. At the bottom of the dialog box, open the Encoding settings, select UTF-8 and save the file as a new file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">To import data from your CSV files:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Data</span> page of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />, open an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> or create a new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />.</li>
            <li>In the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/v7databutton.png" class="docbutton" />. The Add Data dialog box is displayed.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Csvonline.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
