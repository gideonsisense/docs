        <h1>Connecting to Microsoft Dynamics CRM</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector is a standalone connector that allows you to import data from Microsoft Dynamics CRM’s API into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />. After you have downloaded and installed the connector, you can connect through a connection string you provide Sisense in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />. The connection string is used to authenticate users who connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM tables. To obtain a connection string, you will need to obtain your credentials from Microsoft Dynamics CRM.</p>
        <p>Once you have connected to Microsoft Dynamics CRM, you can import a variety of tables from the Microsoft Dynamics CRM API.</p>
        <p>This page describes how to install the Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector, how to connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM with a connection string, and what tables you can import into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />:</p>

        <h2 class="notoc"><a name="Installi"></a>Installing the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> provides the Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector as a standalone connector that you can download and add to your list of default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> connectors.</p>
        <p class="bold">To install the Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://data.sisense.com/connectors/jvm/latest/release/Microsoft DynamicsCRM.Connector.Installer.exe">Download</a> the Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation file.</li>
            <li>Open the installation file and click <span class="bold">Install</span>.</li>
            <li>After the installation process is complete, click <span class="bold">Close</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="indent">The Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector is displayed in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> under <span class="bold">Add Data</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Web Services</span>.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc"><a name="Connecti"></a>Connecting to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM</h2>
        <p>The connection string used to connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM connects to various instances you have in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM. By providing your Microsoft Dynamics CRM credentials as values in the connection string, you can add Microsoft Dynamic CRM tables to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc"><a name="Adding"></a>Adding Microsoft Dynamics CRM Tables to your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /></h3>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> uses connection strings to connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM and import data into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />.</p>
        <p>The connection string to connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM has the following structure:</p>
        <p>jdbc:dynamicscrm:Property1=Value1;Property2=Value2;</p>
        <p>The following is an example of a Microsoft Dynamics CRM connection string:</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:dynamicscrm:User=xxxxxxxxxx;Password=xxxxxxxxxx;URL=https://xxxxxxxxxx.dynamics.com/;CRMVersion=CRM Online Office 365;</p>
        <p>To connect to your instance, set the User and Password properties, under the Authentication section, to valid Dynamics CRM user credentials and set the Url to a valid Dynamics CRM server organization root.</p>
        <p>Additionally, set the CRMVersion property. Supported versions are CRM Online Office 365, CRM 4.0, CRM 2011, CRM 2013, CRM 2015.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Note</span>: To switch between accounts, you need to delete the file OAuthsettings.txt file located at …\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\CData\Microsoft Dynamics CRM Data Provider or you can add OAuthSettingsLocation to the connection string. See Switching between Accounts for more information.</p>
        <p class="bold">To add Microsoft Dynamics CRM data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />, click <span class="bold">Add Data</span> and then, <span class="bold">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</span>. The Connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM window is displayed.</li>
            <li>In <span class="bold">Datasource Connection String</span>, enter your connection string.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Connect to Server</span>. Microsoft Dynamics CRM is displayed in the Select Database list.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span>. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> connects to Microsoft Dynamics CRM and displays a list of tables available for you to import.</li>
            <li>Select the relevant tables and click <span class="bold">Add</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="indent">The tables are displayed in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you have any problems connecting to your data source, see <a href="https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360013657533-Troubleshooting-JDBC-Data-Connectors?flash_digest=bb409caea6311b2ed547437d608be67bdab8187d">Troubleshooting JDBC Data Connectors</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Switching between Accounts</h3>
        <p>When you connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM data source, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> saves your OAuth values in the file OAuthsettings.txt file located at …\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\CData\Microsoft Dynamics CRM Data Provider on your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> server. To connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM data source with another user on the same machine, you must delete the OAuthsettings.txt file. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> will then generate a new file for that user.</p>
        <p>Another option to support multiple users is to define the location and file name of an OAuthsettings file for each unique user in your connection string through the OAuthSettingsLocation parameter. When each user connects to the data source, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> generates the OAuth file with the file name you specify in the location you define. In the examples below, two users are allowed to access the Microsoft Dynamics CRM data source and for each user, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> generates a file that contains that user’s OAuth values in the location defined in the string.</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:MicrosoftDynamicsCRM:OAuthSettingsLocation=C:\MicrosoftDynamicsCRM\auth\john.txt;OAuthClientId=11276856774486;</p>
        <p class="code">OAuthClientSecret=064c70d78567jm2b7e7e4224fad;InitiateOAuth=GETANDREFRESH;Version=2.8;CallbackURL=http://localhost/;</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:MicrosoftDynamicsCRM:OAuthSettingsLocation=C:\MicrosoftDynamicsCRM\auth\sally.txt;OAuthClientId=11276856774486;</p>
        <p class="code">OAuthClientSecret=064c70d78567jm2b7e7e4224fad;InitiateOAuth=GETANDREFRESH;Version=2.8;CallbackURL=http://localhost/;</p>
        <p>In the example above, to OAuth files are created, one for John and one for Sally in the location C:\MicrosoftDynamicsCRM\auth\.</p>
        <p>This is useful if you support many users who each need to access the Microsoft Dynamics CRM data source.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc"><a name="Microsof"></a>Microsoft Dynamics CRM Tables</h2>
