        <h1>Connecting to Excel</h1>
        <p><span class="bold">Note:</span>&#160;This topic describes how to import data using the online <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />. To import data through the desktop <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />, click <a href="excel.htm">here</a>. </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> enables easy and quick access to tables contained within Excel spreadsheets.</p>
        <p>There are two options for uploading data, the first is to upload your file to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server. Once the file is uploaded, the data will be imported into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> as it was at the time the file was uploaded.</p>
        <p>The second option is to define the location of your files on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server. This is the preferred option if your Excel files frequently change, but remain in the same location on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Server as the data is taken from the Excel files each time the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> is built.</p>
        <p>When you import multiple files from a folder and build your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />, the data is combined together in a single table. To build multiple tables with separate tables for each file, you must repeat the process for each file you want to import as a table. If you have any questions about data accumulation between builds, please contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Support.</p>
