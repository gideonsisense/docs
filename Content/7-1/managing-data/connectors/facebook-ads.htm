        <h1>Connecting to Facebook Ads</h1>
        <p>The Sisense Facebook Ads connector is a standalone connector that allows you to import data quickly from your Facebook Ads account into the ElastiCube Manager without custom SQL. This connector includes several features to enable you to quickly and easily import data from Facebook Ads:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date range selector from with the ElastiCube Manager</li>
            <li>Support for accumulative builds</li>
            <li>Retry mechanism to improve build success</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you have downloaded and installed the connector, you can connect to Facebook Ads through a connection string you provide Sisense in the ElastiCube Manager. The connection string is used to authenticate users who connect to Facebook’s APIs.</p>
        <p>This page describes how to install the Facebook Ads connector, how to connect to Facebook Ads with a connection string, and what tables you can import into the ElastiCube Manager.</p>

        <p class="bold">Breaking Changes for the Marketing API Version 2.8</p>
        <p>As of July 25, 2017, Facebook no longer supports their Marketing API version 2.8. Currently, all users whose Facebook app is v2.8 will receive an error. To overcome this issue, add the parameter ‘Version=2.10’ to the connection string.</p>
        <p>For more information about the latest version of the Marketing API, see Facebook’s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/ads/blog/post/2017/07/18/marketing-api-2.10/">blog posts</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Facebook Ads connector requires Sisense V6.6.1 and later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="notoc">Installing the Facebook Ads Connector</h2>
        <p>Sisense provides the Facebook Ads connector as a standalone connector that you can download and add to your list of default Sisense connectors. After you install the Facebook Ads connector, it is added to your list of Web Service connectors.</p>
        <p class="bold">To install the Facebook Ads connector:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://data.sisense.com/connectors/jvm/latest/release/FacebookAds.Connector.Installer.exe">Download</a> the Facebook Ads installation file.</li>
            <li>Open the installation file and click <span class="bold">Install</span>.</li>
            <li>After the installation process is complete, click <span class="bold">Close</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Facebook Ads connector is displayed in the ElastiCube Manager under <span class="bold">Add Data &gt; Web Services</span>.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/fbads1.png" class="thumblarge" /></p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Connecting to the Facebook Ads</h2>
        <p>To access Facebook Ads’ data from Sisense, you must provide valid Facebook Ads credentials in a connection string.</p>
        <p>This section describes how to create a Facebook app to retrieve the necessary authentication parameters for the connections string and then how to construct the connection string.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Note</span>: If you have already created a connection string for the Facebook connector, you can use the same credentials in the Facebook Ads connection string.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Creating an App</h3>
        <p>The credentials you need to connect to your data in Facebook are provided by Facebook when you create a Facebook app through the Facebook Developer site.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="create-app-facebook.htm">Creating an App in Facebook</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Creating a Connection String</h3>
        <p>Sisense uses connection strings to connect to Facebook Ads and import data into the ElastiCube Manager. Each connection string contains authentication parameters that the data source uses to verify your identity and what information you can export to Sisense.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Note</span>: When switching accounts, you must sign out of your account and then sign it with the new account.</p>
        <p>After you have obtained the relevant credentials, you can create the connection used to connect to your Facebook account. The Facebook connection string has the following structure:</p>
        <p>jdbc:DataSourceName:Property1=Value1;Property2=Value2;</p>
        <p>The following is an example of Facebook connection string:</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:facebook:OAuthClientId=112345383774486;OAuthClientSecret=064c524478d712534b7e7e4224fad;</p>
        <p class="code">InitiateOAuth=GETANDREFRESH;Version=2.8;CallbackURL=http://localhost/;Timeout=0;ThrottleSeconds=15;</p>
        <p class="code">ThrottleMaxPercent=90;Other=RetryWaitTime=60000;MaximumRequestRetries=5;</p>
        <p>The example above includes both mandatory and optional parameters you can provide in the connection. The required parameters are emphasized in bold.</p>
        <p class="bold">Mandatory Parameters</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">OAuthClientId</span>: Set this to the App ID in your app settings.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">OAuthClientSecret</span>: Set this to the App Secret in your app settings.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">CallbackURL</span>: Set this to the Return URL in your app settings.</li>

        <h2 class="notoc">Adding Facebook Ads Tables to your ElastiCube</h2>
        <p>After you have changed the connectivity settings of the predefined ElastiCube, or if you want to create your own ElastiCube from scratch, you can add Facebook Ads tables exposed by the Facebook API.</p>
        <p>Facebook provides access to data associated with the Facebook account you defined in the connection string. Once you have connected, Sisense displays a list of Facebook Ads tables you can import. For a list of supported tables, see Facebook Ads Tables.</p>
        <p class="bold">To add Facebook Ads data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In ElastiCube Manager, click <span class="bold">Add Data</span> and then, <span class="bold">Facebook Ads</span>. The Connect to Facebook window is displayed.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/fbads2.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Date Range fields</span>, select the date range for the relevant Facebook Ads data you want to import.<br /><span class="bold">Note</span>: When performing an accumulative build, if you change the date range from your previous build, select <span class="bold">Delete existing Data</span> to prevent duplication.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/FBaccum.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>In <span class="bold">Datasource Connection String</span>, enter your connection string.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Connect to Server</span>. Facebook is displayed in the Select Database list.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span>. Sisense connects to Facebook and displays a list of tables available for you to import. For a list of tables you can import, see Facebook Ads Tables.</li>
            <li>Select the relevant tables and click <span class="bold">Add</span>. The tables are displayed in the ElastiCube Manager.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="bold">Tip</span>: Facebook Ads leverages the Facebook Marketing API, however, this API includes user request limitations. To overcome this limitation, try to reduce the date range or query fewer Ad accounts by removing them from your developers profile (<span class="bold">Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Ad Account IDs</span>). For more information, see Facebook’s Marketing Rate limitations.</p>
        <p>If you have any problems connecting to your data source, see <a href="https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360013657533-Troubleshooting-JDBC-Data-Connectors?flash_digest=bb409caea6311b2ed547437d608be67bdab8187d">Troubleshooting JDBC Data Connectors</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Facebook Ads Tables</h2>
        <p>The table below describes the tables you can import from various Facebook APIs. Facebook limits the number of calls and the amount of data that you can retrieve from their APIs. These limitations depend on which Facebook API you are using and your account type. When you reach a limit, Sisense returns the error provided by Facebook. For example, if you receive any of the following error codes, this usually indicates that you have reached one of Facebook’s limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>error code = 4, CodedException</li>
            <li>error code = 32, CodedException</li>
            <li>error code = 17,  User request limit reached</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you encounter one of these errors, refer to the Facebook API that exposed the table for more details regarding that API’s limitations.</p>

        <h3 class="notoc">Version 6.6.1.45</h3>
        <p class="bold">Breaking Changes</p>
        <p>In the latest version of the Facebook Graph API, permissions have been largely reworked. All of the friends* permissions have been removed. In addition, most permissions require Facebook approval if you wish to request information about other user accounts who are not an administrator of the Facebook App. Sisense recommends reviewing the new permissions listed by Facebook here:</p>
        <p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.1" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/v2.1</a>
        </p>
        <p>In addition, users may reject requested permissions in the Authorization dialog on Facebook. If this happens, the specific Permissions requested will state that they are declined under the Status column. The permission may be rerequested by executing GetOAuthAccessToken and setting AuthType to rerequest.</p>
        <p>If you want to keep using an old version of the API, you can by simply setting the Version connection property in the connection string to the specific version you were using and also setting the Location to a folder where you have saved an older copy of the schema files (.rsd and .rsb files).</p>
        <p>If you want to update your app to 2.9, then you don’t have to do anything</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Note</span>: Sisense removed few metrics from the AdInsights / AdInsightsActions due to their removal by Facebook in 2.9.</p>
        <p>A number of various changes have been made across tables due to changes in Facebook. These changes are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facebook no longer allows public posts to be searched. We have had to remove SearchTerms from the Posts table because of this.</li>
            <li>Checkins have been removed from the Graph API. Due to this, we have removed the Checkins table.</li>
            <li>Events may no longer be inserted, updated, or deleted via the Graph API. We have had to change the Events table to a view.</li>
            <li>Usernames for Facebook Users may no longer be used as a target and are no longer returned. The Facebook username for Pages is unaffected.</li>
            <li>User ID’s for Facebook Users will be different across different Facebook Apps. This is due to the new policy of App-scoped User ID’s.</li>
        </ul>
