        <h1>Connecting to eBay</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> eBay connector is a standalone connector that allows you to import data from eBay’s API into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />. After you have downloaded and installed the connector, you can connect through a connection string you provide <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />. The connection string is used to authenticate users who connect to eBay’s API.  The connection string contains parameters that define who is trying to access the eBay API.</p>
        <p>Once you have connected to eBay, you can import a variety of tables from the eBay API.</p>
        <p>This page describes how to install the eBay connector, how to connect to eBay with a connection string, and what tables you can import into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />:</p>

        <h2 class="notoc"><a name="Installi"></a>Installing the eBay Connector</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> provides the eBay connector as a standalone connector that you can download and add to your list of default Sisense connectors.</p>
        <p class="bold">To install the eBay connector:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Contact us for the eBay installation file.</li>
            <li>Open the installation file and click <span class="bold">Install</span>.</li>
            <li>After the installation process is complete, click <span class="bold">Clos</span>e.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="indent">The eBay connector is displayed in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" /> under <span class="bold">Add Data</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Web Services</span>.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc"><a name="Connecti"></a>Connecting to the eBay REST API</h2>
        <p>There are two authentication methods available for connecting to eBay: Using a token generated for accessing only personal data or using tokens that allow other users to access their own data. Both methods require you to join the eBay Developers Program.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Register and Get Your Keys</h3>
        <p>After joining the eBay Developers Program, you can obtain the following values from the Application Keys page.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>AppID</li>
            <li>DevID</li>
            <li>CertID</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/appkeyebay.png" class="thumblarge" />
        </p>
        <p>If you’re working with your own account, follow the steps below to generate a token:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to your Developer Account Dashboard and open the <span class="bold">Application Key</span>s page.</li>
            <li>In the App Id row for the key set you want to use, click <span class="bold">User Tokens</span>. Use production keys if you’re searching for real items or listing real items to the live eBay site. Use sandbox keys if you’re creating test listings in the sandbox.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Get a User Token Here</span> and log in with credentials for either your sandbox or production eBay account.</li>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/ebaysand.png" class="thumblarge" />
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Get a Token from eBay via Your Application</span> and enter a title for your application and the relevant callback and return URLs. From this page you can also retrieve your RuName, which is a mandatory parameter that needs to be included in the connection string.</li>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/ebaytoken.png" class="thumblarge" />
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After setting the following connection properties, you are ready to connect.</p>

        <p>After you have retrieve your API Key or OAuth credentials from eBay, you provide the relevant information in a connection string. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> uses connection strings to connect to eBay and import data into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />. Each connection string contains a authentication parameters that the data source uses to verify your identity and what information you can export to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p>The connection string to eBay is in the following format:</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:ebay:MyDevID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;</p>
        <p>For OAuth, the connection string to eBay is in the following format:</p>
        <p class="code">jdbc:ebay:DevID=MyDevID;AppID=MyAppID;CertID=MyCertID;RuName=MyRuName;SiteID=0;OAuthAccessToken=MyOAuthAccessToken</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">DevID</span>: Set this to the Developer ID from your key set.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">AppID</span>: Set this to the Application ID from your key set.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">CertID</span>: Set this to the Certificate ID from your key set.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">RuName</span>: Set this to the Redirect URL name on the Token from eBay via your Application section of the User Tokens page.</li>

            <li>I<span class="bold">nitiateOAuth</span>: Set this to GETANDREFRESH.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Sandbox</span>:  If you are using the sandbox environment add UseSandbox=true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">To add eBay data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ECM" />, click <span class="bold">Add Data</span> and then, <span class="bold">eBay</span>. The Connect to eBay window is displayed.</li>
