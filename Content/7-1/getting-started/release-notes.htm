            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Following recent security improvements, the return_to URL must redirect users to a URL with the same protocol and domain as the URL where the authentication request originated from. Keep in mind, if your domain’s port is not the default port 80, you must include the port as part of the domain in the value of the return_to parameter, for example, return_to=http://localhost:8081.</p>
                <p>If you have implemented SSO with a JWT token, your scripts should be updated to ensure that your user is redirected as expected.</p>
                <p>For more information, see <a href="../administration/user-management/single-sign-on/sso-jwt.htm">SSO via JWT</a>.</p>

                <p>The /settings/sso endpoints in the REST API V1.0 have a new attribute <span class="bold">syncGroupsFromSamlToken</span>.</p>
                <p>When using SAML SSO, you can specify which groups the user belongs to as part of the SAML SSO token. The user is associated with these groups when the user is first created during the SAML SSO login process.</p>
                <p>This new attribute controls whether to update the user’s groups from the SAML SSO token on subsequent logins.</p>
                <p>By default the value is "false", meaning the user’s groups are updated only when the user is created. Specify “true” to synchronize the user’s groups on each login via SAML SSO.  Specifying “true” will overwrite any manual changes to the user’s groups made in the Sisense application.</p>

                <p>Following recent improvements to the Sisense application database, if you have implemented high availability with a MongoDB replica set or connect to the application database remotely, you need to modify the mongodbconfig.conf file and change the values of bindIp from an array to a string.</p>

                <p>Following recent security improvements in Sisense V6.7.1.15016, the return_to URL must redirect users to a URL with the same protocol and domain as the URL where the authentication request originated from.

                <p>If you have implemented SSO with a JWT token, your scripts should be updated to ensure that your user is redirected as expected.</p>

                <p>Sisense has improved the security of the application database included in the Sisense installation. All access to it must now be authenticated.

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Starting from early 2017, SalesForce will require use of TLS 1.1 and higher to login to SalesForce services.To ensure uninterrupted service, you should upgrade to Sisense version 6.5 or higher, prior to the SalesForce login protocol change in early 2017.</p>
                <p>Sisense has developed a new Sisense SalesForce connector that supports v37.0 of the SalesForce API.</p>
                <p>The latest API includes changes to some of the SalesForce tables. Consequently, you may need to refresh the connectivity settings and your table's fields. Then, rebuild your ElastiCube’s schema or your ElastiCube build will fail due to the change in the SalesForce v37.0 API.For more information about changes to the SalesForce API, click <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.202.0.api.meta/api/sforce_api_quickstart_intro.htm">here</a>.</p>

                <p>To ensure that SisenseJS continues to work after installing Sisense 6.5, your Sisense HTML content must be encapsulated within a div element with the ID "sisenseApp".</p>
                <p>This is required for all Sisense.js scripts whether or not your website uses the Angular framework.</p>

                <p>The Google AdWords API has been updated to the latest version – v201605. In addition, Sisense has updated the Google Adwords connector that is 10x faster and more robust than its predecessor.</p>
                <p>1 - Refreshing AdWords tables</p>
                <p>The v201605 API version includes changes to some of the AdWords predefined columns. Consequently, it is required for you to click refresh in the 'Change Connectivity Settings...' window next to your AdWords data source and rebuild your ElastiCube. Unless this action is taken, your ElastiCube build will fail due to the change in Google AdWords schema.</p>
                <p>2 - .NET 4.5.2</p>
                <p>Your system has to be updated with .NET 4.5.2 for the updated AdWords connector to work</p>
