        <h1>Sending Email Dashboard Reports</h1>
        <p>After you share your dashboard, you can configure the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Scheduler to send periodic email reports containing a static version of the dashboard that can be clicked to access the dashboard or PDFs containing images of your dashboard.</p>
        <p>From your dashboard, you can configure how many emails the Scheduler sends and when.</p>
        <p>To test how the report is to be displayed to your shared users, in the Shared Dashboard window, click the <span class="bold">Send me a report now</span> link, which generates an email report sent to your email address immediately.</p>
        <p class="bold">To schedule email notifications:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In your dashboard, click the Share icon to display the Share window.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/shareicons.png" class="docbutton" /></li>
            <li>In the Shared Dashboard window, click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/emailreporticon.png" class="docbutton" /> tab.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/emailreports.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>Select the type of report you want to send. There are two types of email reports you can send:<br /><span class="bold">Email Report</span>: The email report is attached as an image file.<br /><span class="bold">PDF Attachment</span>: The email report is attached as a PDF. You can define how the dashboard is to be displayed in the PDF through the PDF Report Settings page by clicking Edit/View PDF Report. For more information, see <a href="custompdf-report.htm">Customizing PDF Reports</a>.</li>
            <li>In the Schedule area, select the frequency for sending email notifications. You can select one of the following options:</li>
            <table>
