            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Whitelabeled">Y</MadCap:conditionalText>ou can drill down into your data in most widgets to get an in-depth view of a selected value.</p>
        <p>In the following example, the pie chart on the left shows a breakdown by gender. This is the original chart as created by the dashboard’s Designer. On the right side, the chart shows a breakdown or drill down showing age groups of the ‘female’ segment from the original pie chart.</p>

        </p>
        <p>With <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> you can drill down from any field to any field, unless disabled by the dashboard’s Designer. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Website">For information about enabling or disabling the drilling feature, see <a href="../creating-dashboards/additional-widget-designs/drill-hierarchy.htm">Drill Hierarchies</a>. </p>
        <p class="bold">To drill down into a chart:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on the item in the widget into which you want to drill down.</li>
            <li>To manually select the drill hierarchy path, select <span class="bold">Drill Into</span>, and then in the In the Data Browser, select the field into which to drill down. If you have already drilled into this chart, then you will have shortcuts to previously selected fields, or select <span class="bold">Choose Another Field</span> to select a different field for the first time.<br />OR<br />Select a predefined drill hierarchy (if available). Predefined drill hierarchies are defined by the dashboard's owner. <br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/drillhie.png" class="thumblarge" /><br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>To drill up to a higher level, click on a breadcrumb. To drill all the way up, click on the X icon.</p>
