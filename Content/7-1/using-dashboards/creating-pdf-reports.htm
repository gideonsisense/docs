        <h1>Creating PDF Reports</h1>
        <p>When you need to take copies of your dashboards with you for meetings or sharing with others, you can generate a PDF report of your dashboard.</p>
        <p>By clicking the   <img src="../../Resources/Images/pdficon.png" /> icon on your dashboard, you can customize your dashboard’s appearance through the PDF Report Settings page. After you have defined how your dashboard is to be displayed, you can download your dashboard locally as a PDF.</p>
        <p class="bold">To create a PDF report:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your dashboard menu, click the PDF icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/pdficon.png" />.<br />The PDF Report Settings page is displayed.</li>
            <li>Customize how your dashboard is displayed in the PDF. For more information, see <a href="custompdf-report.htm">Customizing PDF Reports</a>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/pdfcreate.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
