        <h1>Customizing PDF Reports</h1>
        <p>If you need to share dashboards with other users, or create a hardcopy for yourself, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> allows you to send an email report to your users or export your dashboard to PDF. Dashboards in email reports or PDFs though look different compared to online dashboard as they serve different purposes. Through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> PDF Report Settings, you can customize and create formatted email reports and PDFs according to your requirements. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> PDF Report Settings allow you to define both the content and design of your report quickly and easily.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/custompdf.png" class="thumblarge" /></p>
        <p>From the PDF Report Settings page, you have two modes, Edit mode, for customizing your PDF, and View mode, for seeing how the dashboard will be displayed in the PDF. In Edit Mode, all the settings you can apply to your report are displayed in the left menu.</p>
        <p>In Edit mode, you can set the size of your widgets by selecting and dragging the borders of each widget. These borders are displayed when Edit mode is toggled on.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In View and Edit mode, you can define your dashboard’s orientation, its layout, and what is displayed in the header and footer on your report.</p>
        <p>After you have customized your report, you can save the settings and use them when sharing reports, or download the report as a PDF.</p>
