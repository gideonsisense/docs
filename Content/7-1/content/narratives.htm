To activate it, contact your Customer Service Manager for more information. Once widget narration has been added to your account, you can enable it for supported widgets from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />.</p><h2 class="notoc">Enabling Narration for Widgets</h2><p>A <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Administrator must activate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Narratives from the System Configuration page of the <span class="bold">Admin</span> page. This generates an Narrative API token that is used to secure the HTTPS communication between <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> and the narrative cloud service. Your widget’s data is sent to the cloud service, which generates the narrative. Therefore, Sisense Narratives requires that your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> server has internet access.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/narrative7.png" class="thumblarge" /></p><p>Once the Administrator has enabled <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Narratives, Designers can enable narration for supported widgets through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />. Narration is enabled on the widget level. This means that you select which widgets need narration, and which widgets don’t.</p><p>This procedure assumes that you have purchased and activated <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Narratives for your account. Contact your Customer Service Manager for more information.</p><p class="bold">To enable narration for your widgets:</p><ol><li>On the Dashboard, click the <span class="bold">Pencil (Edit)</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/pencil1.png" class="docbutton" /> button that appears in the top-right corner of a widget that supports narration.</li><li>In Edit Widget mode, on the right pane, toggle the Narration switch.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/narrative6.png" class="thumblarge" /><br />The widget will be narrated in the dashboard and the narration customization options are displayed below the Narration switch.

You can display the narration above or below your visualization, or display just the narrative.</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td>Select the format of the narrative as paragraphs or bullets.</td></tr><tr><td>Verbosity</td><td>Select how descriptive the narrated text is, High, Medium, or Low.</td></tr><tr><td>Singular vs. Plural</td><td>Define how singular and plural dimension names appear in the singular and the plural in the narrated text. The default name of the dimension is taken from the label of the field that is added to the widget. For example, the dimension Date is written Date in the singular, and Dates when plural. Each dimension in your widget is listed with two fields, Singular and Plural. Enter the correct spelling for the Category in Singular and Plural Tense.</td></tr><tr><td>Sentiment</td><td>Select the sentiment for your narrated text depending on the trends of your data. The sentiment determines if the narrated text is positive or negative. For example, Sales figures can be narrated positively as they increase but negatively when they decrease.</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregation</td><td>Select the aggregation type to define how data totals and summaries are calculated in your narrated text. For example, if you select <span class="bold">Sum</span>, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> calculates the totals of your data and customizes the text to fit this scenario. If you select <span class="bold">Average</span>, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> calculates the average and customizes the text accordingly.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&#160;</p></body>
