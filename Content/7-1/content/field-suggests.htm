        <h1>Field Suggestions</h1>
        <p>To quickly and easily create meaningful visualizations in your dashboard, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> displays field suggestions to Dashboard Designers when creating new widgets.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/v7fieldsuggestions.png" class="thumblarge" />
        </p>
        <p>After creating your first dashboard, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> begins to display field suggestions the next time you create a widget.</p>
        <p>When determining what fields to suggest, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> looks at fields being used in other widgets on the same server, which fields are typically working together in other widgets, and what fields you have already selected.</p>
        <p>Fields that are already being used in the widget are not suggested.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> has exposed the POST /suggestions API endpoint in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> 1.0 REST API that enables you to retrieve a list of suggestions based on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />’s algorithm for calculating field suggestions. This is useful for displaying suggested fields in your own application. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Whitelabeled">For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.sisense.com/display/API2/REST+API+Reference+-+v1.0"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />e REST API documentation</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
