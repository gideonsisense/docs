        <p>All timestamps that appear in Sisense Monitor are displayed according to your browser’s timezone.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Filtering Your Servers</h3>
        <p>When you log in to Sisense Monitor, the data displayed is the aggregated data for all of the servers together. You can filter the data to display only the data relevant for a specific server by hovering over the server in the Host List widget and clicking <img src="../../Resources/Images/smadd.png" class="docbutton" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/smhosts.png" class="thumblarge" />
        </p>
        <p>You can select <img src="../../Resources/Images/smfilter.png" /> to exclude the data of a specific server from being displayed in Sisense Monitor.</p>
        <p>Each time you filter a server, the data displayed in Sisense Monitor is refreshed.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Changing Your Password</h3>
        <p>If you need to change your Sisense Monitor password, from the Sisense Monitor homepage, click <span class="bold">Forgot Password</span> and enter account username or email.</p>
        <p>Sisense will send an email with a URL to change your password. This URL is valid for 24 hours, afterwards, you must generate a new URL to change your password.</p>
        <p>Open this URL and enter the new password. The password must be at least 8 characters.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Host List</h3>
        <p>This widget displays the list of your hosts together with the total number of log records sent by the host in the selected time period.</p>
        <p>The amount of log files sent by a server depends on its usage. Log files about system resource utilization are sent every minute, regardless of the server usage. Logs about queries and builds are only sent when queries and builds occur. On a server that is not running builds, there won’t be any build or query logs.</p>
        <p>The amount of logs sent varies depending on how your server is used, however, the amount should be relatively consistent unless your server has recently changed.</p>

        <p>Sisense Monitor enables you to monitor and troubleshoot issues on your Sisense system.</p>
        <p>This section describes how to use the Sisense Monitor to troubleshoot potential issues with your ElastiCube server and dashboards.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Debugging ElastiCube Issues</h3>
        <p>Sisense Monitor can help you troubleshoot errors such as build failures, frozen builds, and server crashes.</p>
        <p>This section describes examples of these errors and how you can troubleshoot them with Sisense Monitor.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Build Failures</span>
        </p>
        <p>There are several reasons your builds can fail ranging from ElastiCube designs to disk space capacity.</p>
        <p>To try to identify where the problem is occurring and take corrective action, when a build fails, check the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Concurrent Builds</span>: Use the <span class="bold">Build Status Timeline</span> widget to check if there were multiple builds running at the same time. Too many concurrent builds can lead to increase in memory usage and may crash the server.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Memory and CPU</span>: The CPU and Memory widgets provide information at the machine level, the Sisense component level, and the ElastiCube level. In case of high memory or high CPU utilization, the information displayed in these widgets allows you to determine what contributed to the high values.<br /><span class="bold">Note</span>: Towards the end of a full build, the ElastiCube memory usage increases and may even double. This is normal memory consumption. Once the build process completes, the memory returns to normal levels. To allow querying during the build process, the process first builds a new ElastiCube from scratch while the existing one is used for queries. Once the build is complete, the old ElastiCube is deleted.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">C Drive Disk Utilization</span>: The C Drive Disk Utilization widget monitors the C drive. This drive should not be more than 80% full. In cases of a full disk space, refer to <a href="https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/articles/230651448-Clean-up-your-C-drive">this article</a>.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Stage of the build</span>: In the widget named <span class="bold">Build Details Table</span> you can view the details of each build and its status. In addition, the <span class="bold">Build Block Timeline</span> widget displays the stages of the build, the type of the build and detailed information about the number of records and data source.<br />Every Entire and Cumulative build process has the following flow:<br />Initializing &gt; Import &gt; Custom Fields &gt; Custom Tables<br />A schema changes build usually only builds the custom tables and fields, and any new table added since the last full build.<br />Every build block represents a table, custom field or custom table. Every block sends a log when it starts and when it ends. In case of a failure the currently running build block will not send an end log, and the start log will not appear as well. In case of a failure, the last available block will be the last successful build block.<br /><span class="bold">Tip</span>: During the processing of custom tables and fields the RAM utilization will start increasing. A failure at this stage may suggest a memory problem, or a syntax problem in the queries.<br /><span class="bold">Tip</span>: In case of failure with high memory consumption, while processing custom objects you should check the ElastiCube’s data modeling and make sure there are no many-to-many relationships.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Network Utilization</span>: Check the network usage and download speed in the <span class="bold">Network Utilization</span> widget. Verify there was no network connectivity issue. If the line is completely flat or if it’s constantly very high with no drops, this indicates a network issue. If the line is very low, the build may have a connectivity timeout on the data sources connections. During the import stage, the network utilization should not be lower than a few Mbps.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">IO utilization</span>: If the line is constantly high, there may be a problem with the disk performance. During the import stage, low usage of RAM is expected as the server is only receiving data from an external source and is not performing any computations. During this time, high network and disk I\O usage are expected. A failure at this stage may suggest a connectivity configuration issue, or a configuration or data limitation issue (long-index, # of records, etc..).<br /><span class="bold">Tip</span>: In case of failure during the import stage with extremely low or high network usage, check the connectivity with the data sources.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Frozen Build</span>
        </p>
        <p>When a build freezes entirely or takes longer than usual to complete, there are a few things you can check to improve performance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Data Source</span>: The connection to the data source is busy. This usually occurs during the import stage along with very low or no network usage and no increase in ElastiCube size on the disk (ElastiCube Virtual Bytes widget). In this case, the data source is likely to close the connection at some point and the build will fail with a connectivity error.<br /><span class="bold">Tip</span>: Check if the Sisense query was received by the data source, and whether it is in a queue, still being processed, or was it cancelled?</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Custom Table</span>: Custom table or custom build hangs could be caused by a change in the custom tables/fields syntax. If the query is different from other builds that were faster, the new query might be too long or complicated. Sisense custom queries timeout in six hours. After six hours of processing the same table, the build will fail. <br /><span class="bold">Tip</span>: If the build hangs while building custom objects, check the query.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Server Crash</span>
        </p>
        <p>A server crash may happen when the memory usage reaches 100%. This can happen due to a combination of concurrent builds or too many queries from the Sisense Web Application.</p>
        <p>When the server crashes, memory utilization will reach a peak and then drop to zero.</p>
        <p>In this case you should restart the ElastiCube management service and verify that the Server Console is able to find the ElastiCubes, and if so, that the ElastiCube are running and your dashboards are working.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Debugging Dashboard Issues</h3>
        <p>If you experience dashboard issues such as widgets or dashboards crashing or longer load times than expected, your web server may be receiving a high amount of concurrent queries.</p>
        <p>When your server receives a high volume of queries, some of the queries are queued and then handled in the order that they were received leading to an increase in average response time.</p>
        <p>If you are experiencing dashboard issues, check the <span class="bold">Query Response Time</span> widget. This widget shows the maximum and average response times over time. A query that timed out will have a response time of 300 seconds (5 minutes), which is the Sisense default timeout for web queries. In addition, check the <span class="bold">Query Status by Cube</span>, which shows you the failed and successful queries for the top 5 queried ElastiCubes, to identify ElastiCubes that might be causing the dashboard issues.</p>
        <p>Once you have narrowed down the time frame to the relevant dashboards’ slow response or failure time, look at the <span class="bold">Query Finish Search</span> widget, where you can view a record of every widget’s execution. Check the status of the queries and look for a pattern in the widgets/dashboards that take longer to return or fail.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Tip</span>: In some cases you’ll be able to pinpoint a heavy widget by the response size, that is a field in the <span class="bold">Query Details Table</span> widget that specifies the response size in bytes.
