        <h2 class="notoc">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Traditional dashboards provide comprehensive access to vast amounts of data, however, sometimes you need quick, actionable insights. The Sisense-Enabled Bulb provides an immediate visual representation of a KPI. Sisense recommends choosing a KPI that is meaningful to your business and you expect might change frequently. KPIs that are relatively static are less meaningful to monitor with the Sisense-Enabled Bulb.</p>

            <a name="How">
            </a>How does it Work?</h2>
        <p>The Sisense-Enabled Bulb is connected to your Wi-Fi connection and dynamically updates when a data alert is triggered. You can create data alerts for a wide array of conditions. To learn more, see <a href="../sisense-pulse-and-alerting/create-data-alert.htm">Data Alerts</a>.</p>
        <p>Sisense can be configured to send a webbook to Zapier each time a data alert is triggered. When the webhook arrives, Zapier sends a request, also known as a ‘Zap’, to LIFX API. The Zap contains the ID of your bulb and defines how your bulb should respond to an alert. For example, how many times the bulb show blink or what color to display.</p>
        <p>To set up an LIFX bulb, connect your LIFX bulb to your Wifi, retrieve an ID for your bulb, and finally, create a Zap that is sent to the LIFX API when your data alert is triggered.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">

            </a>Connecting the Sisense-Enabled Bulb to Your WiFi</h2>
        <p>To connect to the Sisense-Enabled Bulb to your wifi, you must download the LIFX app. The LIFX provides an interface in Apple or Android-based mobile devices for defining your bulb’s color and connections settings.</p>
        <p class="bold">To connect to the Sisense-Enabled Bulb:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Before plugging the lamp into the power outlet, screw the bulb into the lamp.</li>
            <li>Plug the lamp into the power outlet and turn it on.<br /><span class="bold">Note</span>: You can reset the lamp by turning the lamp on and off 5 times. When you reset the lamp you must complete this procedure again.</li>
            <li>Download and install LIFX. For Apple-based mobile devices, click <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifx/id657758311?mt=8" target="_blank">here</a>, and for Android, click <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifx.lifx" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

        <h2 class="notoc">
            <a name="Retrievi">
            </a>Retrieving a Sisense-Enabled Bulb Token</h2>
        <p>To allow Sisense to communicate with your LIFX bulb, you must provide Sisense with access to your LIFX bulb. After you provide access, LIFX returns a token that you include in your Zap that enables your bulb to authenticate requests from Sisense when updating your bulb’s color.</p>
        <p class="bold">To retrieve a token:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In your web browser, open the Sisense LIFX authorization site located <a href="https://bulbi.sisense.com/lifxauth/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/lifxsign.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>Enter your LIFX account email address and password in the relevant fields.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Sign in</span>. The Authorization page is displayed.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/authapp-1.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>In the Authorization page, click <span class="bold">Authorize</span>. Your Sisense BulbiToken is displayed.</li>

            </a>Connecting Your Bulb to Sisense</h2>
        <p>Now that have set up your bulb and retrieved a token, you can create a Zap that defines how your bulb responds to a data alert.</p>
        <p>When connecting your bulb to Sisense, you need Sisense V6.5 or later and a Zapier account. If you do not have a Zapier account, you can make one for free here.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>: Repeat this procedure for every color you want your bulb to support. For example, if you use colors green and red to represent alerts, repeat this procedure twice, once for each color.</p>
        <p class="bold">To configure Zapier to work with the Sisense-Enabled Bulb:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to your Zapier account.</li>

            </a>Troubleshooting the Sisense-Enabled Bulb</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bulbs are designed to communicate on channels 1 through 11 on the 2.4GHz (802.11 b,g,n) spectrum. If your router is in auto-channel mode, disable it and ensure you are somewhere between channels 1 through 11. We suggest channels 1, 6, or 11, as these are the only channels that are non-overlapping.</li>
            <li>You can reset the bulb by turning it on and off 5 times in a row. When you reset the lamp you must reconnect the lamp as described <a href="#Connecti">here</a>.</li>
