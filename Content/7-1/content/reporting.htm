        <h1>Sending Email Reports via the REST API</h1>
        <p>With the Sisense REST API, you and your customers can send email reports with your users and groups programmatically through your native application.</p>
        <p>Email reports contain static versions of a dashboard that can be clicked to access the dashboard or PDFs containing images of your dashboard.</p>
        <p>Both versions of the REST API support reporting. Version .9 was developed prior to Sisense 6.0 whereas Version 1.0 was designed afterwards and has improved endpoints.</p>
        <p>The send report endpoint receives asset info and recipients list and sends an email report.</p>
        <p>Note: The users and groups in the recipients section must be shared to the dashboard.</p>
        <p class="bold">API Version .9</p>
