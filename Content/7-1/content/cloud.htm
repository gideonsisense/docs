        <h1>Sisense Cloud Security Controls</h1>
        <p>Sisense Cloud is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This enables Sisense’s software to take advantage of the robust security and compliance certifications available on AWS. More information about AWS Security can be found at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/</a>.  A list of certifications and assurance programs can be found at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/</a>.</p>
