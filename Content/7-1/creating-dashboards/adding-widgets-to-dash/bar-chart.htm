        <h1>Bar Chart</h1>
        <p>The Bar Chart is commonly used to compare many items. The Bar Chart typically presents categories or items (descriptive data) displayed along the Y-Axis, with their values displayed on the X-Axis. You can also break up the values by another category or groups.</p>

        <h2 class="notoc">Adding Data</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Categories</span> panel, click <span class="bold">Add+</span> to select the field(s) whose values will be placed on the Y-Axis.<br />Typically, the Y-Axis of a Bar chart is descriptive data. You must add at least one item to <span class="bold">Categories</span>, and a maximum of two items. When you add two fields to Categories, then the chart’s Y-Axis are combined.</li>
            <li>In <span class="bold">VALUES</span>, select the fields whose values determine the length of each column. Typically, the values of a Bar Chart are used to represent numeric data.<br />You must add at least one field to <span class="bold">Values</span>. When you add more than one value, each item is represented in the chart by its own color and area.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Select a field by which to break (group) the data represented in this chart by clicking <span class="bold">Add +</span>.<br />Each group is represented by a different column and is automatically added to the chart’s legend.<br />Break by is optional, and operates under the following conditions:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>You can add at most one <span class="bold">Break by</span> field.</li>
            <li>The <span class="bold">Break by</span> option is available only when a single field was added to <span class="bold">Values</span> (Y-AXIS).</li>
            <li>You can only add a single field to <span class="bold">Values</span> if the <span class="bold">Break by</span> option was used.</li>
        </ul>
