        <h1>Creating Dashboards</h1>
        <p>This topic describes how to create a new dashboard. </p>
        <p>There are two ways you can create dashboards, first, through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />, and the second, through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> REST API.</p>
        <p>The difference between these two methods is the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" /> provides an interface where you populate the dashboard with widgets.</p>
        <p>To create a dashboard through the REST API, you define the dashboard and then populate it with widgets that already exist through their widget IDs.</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Creating a Dashboard</h2>
        <p>Each Dashboard is based on the data selected from one or more <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />s or data sets. The instructions below assume that the required <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />(s) and data set(s) have already been created. You can also use the sample <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />s that are installed with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> if you have not yet created your own.</p>
        <p class="bold">To create a dashboard:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Analytics</span> page, click <span class="bold">+</span> above the Dashboards list.<br />OR<br />Right-click on the folder menu and select <span class="bold">New Dashboard</span>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/v7newdash1.png" class="thumblarge" /><br />The following window appears:<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/v7sampledash.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>Click the name of the <span class="bold">Data Set</span> displayed to select the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> or data set you want to work with. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />s have the <img src="../../Resources/Images/ecubeicon.png" /> next to their name while data sets have the <img src="../../Resources/Images/liveiconnew.png" /> icon next to their name.</li>
            <li>Click the name of the <span class="bold">Title</span>, and enter a name for the dashboard. This name will appear at the top of the dashboard, and in the <span class="bold">Dashboards</span> list.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Create</span>.<br />You are then automatically guided through the process of creating your first widget in the Widget Wizard, as described in <a href="adding-widgets-to-dash/add-widget-to-dash.htm">Adding Widgets to a Dashboard</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Creating Dashboards through the REST API</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> REST API enables you to programmatically create dashboards by defining the basic properties of a dashboard such as Title, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> (datasource), and owner. After defining the properties of the dashboard, you define its visualizations by including the widget IDs of pre-existing widgets.</p>
        <p class="bold">To create a dashboard through the REST API:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" />, click <span class="bold">Admin</span> at the top, and then <span class="bold">REST AP</span>I, followed by REST API Reference.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/v7restapi.png" class="thumblarge" /><br /></li>
            <li>Select <span class="bold">Dashboards</span> then <span class="bold">POST /dashboards</span>.</li>
            <li>In the body of your call, define the values of the following keys:<br /></li>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
