        <h1>Date and Time Fields</h1>
        <p>Many widgets include data that is relative to date and time fields. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> enables you to apply date and time filters so you can easily identify trends in your data.</p>
        <p>When you create a widget in your dashboard that includes a date field, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> automatically breaks the data down by year, however, you can change this to a shorter resolution. For example, a Date field included in a widget can be separated into Years, Quarters, Months, Weeks, Days, and Time from your widget’s filter.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/tdateandtime1.png" class="thumblarge" /></p>
        <p>Dashboard Viewers have the option to drill down the widget according to the Date level as shown in the following image:<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/v7time3.png" class="thumblarge" /></p>
        <p>Viewers can drill down into the lowest date or time resolution available in your data.</p>
        <p>The highest resolution available is by Year and the lowest resolution is Time, which includes Hour and Minute intervals.</p>
