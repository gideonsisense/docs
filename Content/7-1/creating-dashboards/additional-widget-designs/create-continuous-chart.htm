        <h1>Creating a Continuous Chart with Missing Date Values</h1>
        <p>If your data is missing date values, you can add the missing dates to your chart to create a continuous data flow. In addition, you can select whether to display missing dates as gaps in your chart, or include null values as zeros, to avoid gaps, and maintain a continuous data flow.</p>
        <p>For example, if your chart begins June 8th and ends June 20th, but there is no value on June 13th, you can choose to include the missing date on the x-axis. You can also choose whether to continue the graph (create zero values) or cut the graph where there are missing values.</p>
        <p>The default chart is missing June 13th.</p>

        </p>
        <p>After selecting the Continuous option, the chart includes the missing date(s).</p>

        <p>In addition, you can select to continue the line, by treating null (missing) values as zero values.</p>
