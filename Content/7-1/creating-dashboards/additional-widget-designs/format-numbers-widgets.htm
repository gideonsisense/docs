        <h1>Formatting Numbers in Widgets</h1>
        <p>You can change the way numbers are displayed and formatted in widgets. For example, you can display a number as a percentage, and you can define the number of decimal places.</p>
        <p class="bold">To format numbers in a widget:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Widget Designer, for example, in the X-Axis, Y-Axis, Values, Categories areas and so on, hover over, and click <span class="bold">123</span>.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/hover-to-format-num.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
            <li>Select how the number, currency or percentage appears. The preview area at the bottom of this window shows a preview of how each option will appear in the widget.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="notoc">Locale Settings</h3>
        <p>The formats for dates, times and numbers in your dashboards are based on your computer’s operating system or browser’s locale settings (depending on which browser you use).</p>
        <p>The following locales are supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unites States</li>
            <li>United Kingdom</li>
            <li>Israel</li>
            <li>Canada</li>
            <li>South Africa</li>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Netherlands</li>
            <li>Germany</li>
            <li>Ireland</li>
            <li>Mexico</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>Brazil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">Notes</span>You can override the default locale settings for all users, by updating a parameter via the Rest API. To use a locale file that is not included in the above list of countries, you can manually add a locale file in the following location: C:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\client\resources\base\localization. Click <a href="../../administration/internationalization-and-localization/international-locale.htm">here</a> to access Locale files and view their codes.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">Currency Settings</h3>
        <p>The default currency symbol used in the dashboard is the US dollar ($), however you can change the symbol by either selecting another symbol from the drop-down list, or by typing in a different symbol. The list of currency symbols will include common currency symbols, the currency defined in your browser’s locale settings, and the symbol that you added (if you did so).</p>
        <p>After you select a different symbol, additional viewers will see the same symbol that you applied.</p>
