        <h1>Combining Two Types of Visualizations in a Widget</h1>
        <p>In chart widgets (such as Line Charts, Area Charts, Column Charts and Bar Charts), you can represent one or more selected field(s) using a different visualization than the visualization of the original widget.</p>
        <p>For example, the following example shows a Line Chart in which the <span class="bold">Total Revenue</span> is still represented as a Line Chart (the default), but the <span class="bold">Total Quantity</span> is represented as a Column Chart.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="bold">To select a different visualization for a field in the widget:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Widget Designer, in the <span class="bold">Values</span> area, right-click the field that you want to change.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="bold">Series Type</span> from the menu. A menu of alternative visualization types is displayed.</li>
            <li>Select the visualization to use for this field only.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Tip</span>: If necessary, drag the field up or down in the Widget Designer to have a visualization brought to back or front.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>: The chart keeps the same visualization type as was originally created. The Design panel still displays only the design options of the widget’s original visualization type.</p>
