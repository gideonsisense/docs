        <h1>Introduction to Filters</h1>
        <p>The Filters panel on the right of the dashboard provides data filtering options that affect the data displayed in the widgets. You can change these filters to focus on more specific data.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> user role determines how you can interact with filters. As a Designer you can create filters that are distributed to Viewers who interact with your dashboards. See <a href="designer-filters/interact-filter-designer.htm">Interacting with Filters as a Designer</a>.</p>
        <p>Viewers can interact with filters and save their changes locally. See <a href="designer-filters/interact-filter-viewer.htm">Interacting with Filters as a Viewer</a> for more information.</p>
