        <h1>Interacting with Filters as a Viewer</h1>
        <p>Viewers can interact with filters for analyzing data. Through the Filters pane, you can modify filters in a dashboard and change the way values are sorted in a visualization. This is useful for focusing on data displayed in dashboards that have been shared by the dashboard’s owner.</p>
        <p>As a Viewer, you can select and deselect filter visuals on a dashboard. Each time you interact with a filter, for example by selecting or entering a value, the filter is immediately applied to your dashboard. After you have configured the relevant filters, you can save it as your default filters view.</p>
        <p>Viewers can interact with filters as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make a different selection in the filter controls displayed in the Filter pane on the right side of the dashboard, as shown below:<br /><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/viewerfilter.png" class="thumblarge" /><br />OR<br />Click on the pencil icon next to the filter name (shown above) in the dashboard to display the Filter Definition window.<br /><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/edit-filter.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, Viewers can perform the following procedures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="switch-filter.htm">Switching Filters On and Off</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="save-default-filter.htm">Saving your Default Filters View</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create a filter you must be a <a href="../../../getting-started/user-roles.htm">Designer</a>.</p>
