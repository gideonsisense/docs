        <p>After you have viewed your dashboards, you may have discovered some insights you want to share. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> supports a variety of ways you can share your data with other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />users. </p>
        <p>Downloading widgets and dashboards as various file types is useful for sharing your data with users or including in your reports and presentations, however, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> makes it easy to share dashboards directly with over <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users by allowing you to share the dashboard's URL from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" /> or sending your insights via email. </p>
        <p>In addition, you can schedule automatic reports to be sent to yourself or other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users. See the <a href="../using-dashboards/send-email-dash-report.htm">Sending Email Dashboard</a> reports for more information.</p>
