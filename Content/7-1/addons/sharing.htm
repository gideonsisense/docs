        <h1>Sharing – Autocomplete Limited to Current User Group</h1>
        <p>The Sharing-autocomplete add-on enhances the Share dashboard and Pulse tile functionality. When sharing a dashboard or a Pulse tile, this add-on limits the auto-complete of user names to users that belong to the current users group.</p>
        <p>This add-on limits which users your Designers can see in the auto-complete results when sharing dashboards. After installing this add-on, your Designers will only be able to see users who are in the same Group as defined in the User Management page.</p>
        <p>For example, if your OEM serves two different companies, Group 1 and Group 2, you do not want allow Designers from Group 1 to see users from Group 2 or vice versa.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>After installing the add-on, Designers from Group 1 can no longer see users from Group 2 when searching for users to share Dashboards with.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>: Users who are not part of a group can see users in any group.</p>
        <p class="bold">To install the Sharing – Auto-complete add-on widget:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="http://download.sisense.com/Product/addons/beforeshareduserssuggested.zip">Download</a> the attachment and unzip the contents into your <span class="bold">C:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\plugins\ </span>folder. If the plugins folder doesn’t exist, just create it. After those files have been unzipped there, you may also have to restart the web server.</li>
            <li>In the User Management page, define groups for your users and add the relevant users to a group.</li>
            <li>Refresh your browser where the Sisense Web Application is displayed. The next time you or your Designer shares a dashboard, only users in their group are displayed.</li>
