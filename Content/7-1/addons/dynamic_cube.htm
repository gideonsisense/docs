        <h1>Changing the ElastiCube Before Loading a Dashboard</h1>
        <p>This topic explains how to dynamically set an ElastiCube before loading a dashboard with the Dynamic <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> add-on.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple ElastiCubes with the same schema (perhaps split by customer), you may want to create a set of dashboards and pick which ElastiCube to query against according to which user logs in.  Normally, you would have to create a dashboard for each ElastiCube to accomplish this, but this add-on allows you to create a single dashboard (or set of dashboards) and dynamically set the ElastiCube when the user loads the web page. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>:&#160;All ElastiCubes used must have the same schema.</p>
        <p class="bold">To change your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" />s dynamically:&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="http://data.sisense.com/Product/addons/dynamicElastiCube.zip">Download</a> the attachment and unzip the contents into your C:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\plugins\ folder. If the plugins folder doesn't exist, just create it. </li>
            <li>Open up C:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\plugins\dynamicElasticube\settings.js and replace the default information.
          <ul><li><span class="bold">server</span>:&#160;This should be the URL of your Sisense server.</li><li><span class="bold">dashboards</span>:&#160;This should be either a list of dashboards where this add-on will be applied, or enter ["all"] to apply this add-on to every dashboard.</li><li><span class="bold">elasticubes</span>:&#160; This should be a list of ElastiCubes that have an identical schema, such as ["Customer-A-Cube", "Customer-B-Cube", "Customer-C-Cube"].</li></ul><pre xml:space="preserve">var dynamicElasticubeSettings = {
      //	Server info 
       server: "http://localhost:8081",
      //	Provide a list of dashboards to apply this plugin to
      dashboards: ["Dynamic Elasticubes"],	//	Apply to a specific list of dashboards
     //dashboards: ["all"]			//	Apply to all dashboards
     //	Provide a list of elasticubes that are available for switching
     //	Note that all elasticubes in this list must have the exact same schema
     elasticubes: ["Northwind2", "Northwind3"],
     //	Leave as is
     allElasticubes: []
};</pre></li>
            <li>Create a set of dashboards built from one of the Elasticubes in the above list.  If you specified a list of dashboards in settings.js, make sure the dashboards you create are in that list.</li>
            <li>Access the dashboards. When accessing your dashboards, append the new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> name to the end of the URL. The add-on will look for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> name and switch the dashboard to use the new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> instead.</li>
        </ol>
        <pre>http://localhost:8081/app/main#/dashboards/5575cfac627dc10c2700001e?elasticube=Northwind3</pre>
        <p>This dashboard is built from an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> named Northwind3, which has data for North America.</p>

        <p>The same dashboard is now querying against an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ElastiCube" /> named Northwind2, which has data for South America.</p>
