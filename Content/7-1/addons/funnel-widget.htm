        <h1>Funnel Widget</h1>
        <p>Funnel charts are a common way to show stages in a process, with the most prevalent example being a funnel representing stages in a sales process. It can display the number of leads, qualified leads, opportunities, and won deals.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>There are two ways to use this chart.  You can either pick a dimension to use as categories, or you can add multiple values.  If you pick a dimension, each member in the dimension will get its own section within the funnel. This chart can be useful for identifying possible problems with the process.</p>
        <p>After you have created the chart, Sisense provides several options for formatting it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Invert Chart</span>: If True, the chart is flipped upside down.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Dynamic Sizing</span>: If True, the size of each section corresponds to the value for that section so larger values will result in bigger sections.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Pinch the Bottom</span>:  If True, the last section of the chart is displayed as a rectangle so that the funnel looks skinnier at the bottom.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Curved Funnel</span>: If True, the funnel is rendered as a 3D funnel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">To install the Funnel widget:</p>
