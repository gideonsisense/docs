        <h1>Managing Dashboards</h1>
        <p>This page is only for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> users who have dashboard editing rights (Designers).</p>
        <h2 class="notoc">Organizing Dashboards in Folders<a name="OrganizeDash"></a></h2>
        <p>You can organize your dashboards into folders and sub-folders within any of your folders to improve how your viewers navigate the Dashboard list.</p>
        <p class="bold">To create a folder:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Dashboard list, click <span class="bold">+</span> and select <span class="bold">New Folder</span>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/newfolder.png" class="thumblarge" /><br />The new folder is added to the dashboards list.</li>
            <li>Hover over the new folder and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/menurename.png" />  &gt; <span class="bold">Rename</span> to name the folder.<br />To create additional sub-folders within your folders, hover over the folder and select &gt; <span class="bold">New Folder</span> and repeat Step 2.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/newfolderrename.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="notoc">Locating a Dashboard<a name="LocateDash"></a></h2>
        <p>You can quickly and easily locate dashboards without having to navigate through your entire list of dashboards. When you enter any characters in the <span class="bold">Search</span> field, the list of dashboards is filtered according to the characters found within your dashboard titles.</p>
        <p class="bold">To locate a dashboard:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Dashboard list, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/magnifying glass.png" /> to display the <span class="bold">Search</span> field.<br /></li>
            <li>In the <span class="bold">Search</span> field, enter the title of your dashboard. Any dashboards that contain the characters you entered are displayed.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/sampleresults.png" class="thumblarge" /></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="notoc">Copying a Dashboard<a name="CopyDash"></a></h2>
        <p>Copying a dashboard (even one that was shared with you) creates a new copy of the dashboard with a different name. This new dashboard is totally separate from the original and you are its owner, meaning that you have full editing rights. When you copy a dashboard, the new dashboard is added below the copied dashboard in your Dashboard list with the same name plus a number in the order it was created.</p>
        <p>For example, Sample Ecommerce(1) is a copy of Sample Ecommerce, while Sample Ecommerce(1)(1) is a copy of Sample Ecommerce(1):</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/sampleecomfolders.png" class="thumblarge" />
        </p>
        <p class="bold">To copy a Dashboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the dashboard’s name in the Dashboard list in the Home page and select <span class="bold">Duplicate</span>.</li>
        </ul>
