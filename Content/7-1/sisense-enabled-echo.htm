        <h2 class="notoc">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> provides you with the means to interact with your data through traditional point-and-click interfaces as well as through voice commands. With a single voice command, you can retrieve and hear your numeric KPIs. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />-Enabled Echo searches your widgets and dashboards to provide you with the best result according to your command.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> enables Amazon’s Echo, which is a voice-powered, wireless-enabled speaker that interfaces with Alexa, to retrieve your data in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />. Alexa is a cloud-based voice service that powers the Echo. Alexa’s default capabilities such as playing music can be extended through skills. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> has developed a Sisense skill that extends the Echo’s functionality and returns numeric KPIs through voice commands.</p>

            <a name="How">
            </a>How does it Work?</h2>
        <p>After launching Sisense via voice command, you can retrieve numeric data quickly by asking Alexa about your KPIs similar to issuing traditional queries through Sisense.  Your Sisense-Enabled Echo listens for the command and forwards it to Alexa.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/alexadiagram.png" class="thumblarge" />
        </p>
        <p>Alexa handles your requests and routes the request to the Sisense ElastiCube where your information is retrieved. Alexa then translates this data into an audio response played back by your Sisense-Enabled Echo.</p>

            </a>Setting Up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />-Enabled Echo</h2>
        <p>Sisense has developed a skill that enables you to retrieve your data via voice commands. This skill takes requests from the Alexa service and leverages the Sisense APIs to retrieve your data.</p>
        <p>To enable your Sisense-Enabled Echo to accept your voice commands and pass them through the Alexa service and the Sisense APIs, you will need to enable the Sisense skill.</p>
        <p>Before setting up your Sisense-Enabled Echo, you may want to create a new user with a single dashboard associated with their account so you can easily test your Echo without returning unexpected results from various dashboards.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note</span>: To participate in the Sisense-Enabled Echo Beta Program, your Sisense server must be accessible over the Internet without a VPN.</p>
        <p class="bold">To set up the Sisense-Enabled Echo:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the Alexa app from the app store and activate it using your email address.</li>
        </ol>

            <a name="Querying">
            </a>Querying the Sisense-Enabled Echo</h2>
        <p>There are two ways you can query your Sisense-Enabled Echo. The first option is to ask a question in a single question session. The second option is to ask your questions in a multi-question session, in which you ask multiple questions in a single session. The difference between the two options is that in single question sessions, you must invoke Sisense each time you ask a question. In a multi-question session, you invoke Sisense once, and then ask your questions without having to invoke Sisense again until after you exit the session.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p class="bold">Single Question Session</p>
        <p>
            <i>“Echo/Alexa, ask Sisense, what is my Total Sales”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“Echo/Alexa, ask Sisense, get Total Visits”</i>
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Multi-Question Session</p>
        <p>
            <i>“Echo/Alexa, Start Sisense” (Opens a multi-question session)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“What is my Total Sales?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“Get Total Visits”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“Provide Total Sales”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“Exit” (Closes a multi-question session)</i>
        </p>

        <h3 class="notoc">Security</h3>
        <p>There are two potential security issues that arise when working with the Sisense-Enabled Echo. The first issue is what happens to data when you ask a question.  When you ask questions and receive answers, your data is sent to and returned from the Alexa service. This data transfer takes place across secured SSL ensuring that no one can access your data.</p>
        <p>The second issue is securing the Sisense-Enabled Echo itself, so no one can access it and retrieve your data. When you say to Alexa, “Deactivate Account”, this disconnects your Sisense-Enabled Echo from your Sisense account. Alexa will ask you to confirm that you want to deactivate your account. If you respond “Yes”, the account is deactivated. No one will be able to access your data through the Sisense-Enabled Echo until the next time you manually reactivate your account.</p>
        <h3 class="notoc">
            <a name="Troubles">
            </a>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>For Amazon Tap and Echo devices, you can use Voice Training. Voice Training helps Alexa understand your speech patterns. During a Voice Training session, the Alexa app shows 25 different phrases, which you say to your device. To learn more, go to Voice Training.</p>
        <p>If your selected language doesn’t match the language settings for your Amazon account, Alexa may not always understand what you say and may have trouble pronouncing things. For example, if you are located in Canada and are having language problems, change the language setting to US English.</p>
        <p>If you have any issues authenticating your Echo, you can try to enable the device from the desktop through the following site.</p>
