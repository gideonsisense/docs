        <h1><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> Alerts</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the two types of alerts you can define, data alerts and system alerts in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p>Data alerts are triggered by changes to your data. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> provides several options for defining the type of changes that trigger data alerts including threshold based alerts, automatic anomaly detection, and Always which is triggered by any change to your data. For example, if you have an Indicator widget that represents total sales, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> can notify you when a threshold you defined is met or exceeded.</p>
        <p>Build alerts can be configured to be sent following build attempts.</p>
        <p>When creating an alert, you can customize your notifications, the channel through which they are sent, and how often a notification is sent following a data or build.</p>
        <p>After you create an alert, the alert is added to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> <span class="bold">Pulse</span> page where you can manage the alert and its notifications. For example, you can delete alerts or enable and disable notifications.</p>
        <p>If you want to make a similar alerts, for example, alerts with different notifications for different groups of users, you can duplicate the alert and modify its settings.</p>
        <p>When an alert is triggered, you and your users are notified through the channel you defined when creating the alert and through the Pulse Feed. The Pulse Feed is displayed in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sisense Web Application" /> and shows a list of your most recent triggered alerts. From the Pulse Feed you can open the dashboard from where the alert originated or open the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> <span class="bold">Pulse</span> page.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/pulsealerts.png" class="thumblarge" /></p>
